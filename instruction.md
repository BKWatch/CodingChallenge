# Steps to run the code:

1.Download CodingChallenge repository and extract it.

2.Upon successful extraction, find the challenge.py file along with additional scripts and input files in formats such as .txt, .xml, and .tsv.

3.To execute this, open your command line interface (cmd) and enter the following command:

**a. For single file use the command:**

    python challenge.py input/<filenames>

**b. FOR multiple files, use the command:**

    python challenge.py input/filename1.txt input/filename2.xml input/filename3.tsv

**Note:** When passing multiple files, you do not need to separate them with commas. Simply list the file names if they are in the current directory, or provide the path if they are located elsewhere.
